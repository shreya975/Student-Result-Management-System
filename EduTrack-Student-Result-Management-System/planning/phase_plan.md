# Phase-wise Project Plan – EduTrack

This document outlines the structured phases followed to design
and plan the EduTrack – Student Result Management System.
The project follows a clear SDLC-style workflow before implementation.

---

## Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Scope Definition
- Identified real-world issues in manual result management
- Defined project objectives and success criteria
- Clearly marked in-scope and out-of-scope features
- Established assumptions and constraints

---

## Phase 2: User Roles & Access Design
- Identified system roles (Admin, Student)
- Defined role responsibilities and permissions
- Designed role-based access control (RBAC)
- Prevented unauthorized access by design

---

## Phase 3: Project Initialization & Structure
- Created professional folder structure
- Organized documentation, design, and data models
- Initialized Git repository
- Prepared system for scalable development

---

## Phase 4: Data Design & Data Models
- Identified core data entities (Users, Students, Subjects)
- Designed normalized JSON schemas
- Defined entity relationships
- Added validation rules and data flow design

---

## Phase 5: Authentication & Access Workflow
- Designed login and session workflow
- Defined role-based redirection logic
- Planned access control rules and failure handling
- Documented authentication pseudo-logic

---

## Phase 6: Result Processing & Grading Logic
- Defined marks validation rules
- Designed GPA calculation logic
- Created grade assignment criteria
- Planned fail/pass evaluation
- Documented result processing workflow

---

## Phase 7: Analytics & Insights Design
- Designed admin-level analytics (global performance)
- Designed student-level analytics (personal performance)
- Defined metrics, aggregation logic, and edge cases
- Planned visualization requirements

---

## Phase 8: UI / UX Flow & Experience Design
- Designed screen list and navigation flow
- Defined role-based UI separation
- Planned interaction feedback and animations
- Handled empty states and error UX

---

## Phase 9: Testing Strategy & Edge Case Planning
- Planned functional testing scenarios
- Defined security and access tests
- Designed edge case handling
- Covered analytics and UX validation

---

## Phase 10: Implementation Roadmap
- Converted design into step-by-step build plan
- Defined correct implementation order
- Reduced development risk and rework
- Prepared system for smooth execution

---

## Current Status
Design and planning phases are completed.
Implementation will follow the defined roadmap.
